To install:
Install omniORB and FFTW:
Either with your repository or for example with (as root):
make fftw
make omniORB (which takes a while)

You may also need to install numpy and matplotlib and gtk, pygtk etc
if you are on a non-standard platform (e.g. get them from your
repository or do (as root) make numpy ; make matplotlib )

Edit /etc/omniORB.cfg to have (or larger if using a large AO system)
giopMaxMsgSize = 209715200    # 200 MBytes


Then run make:
make

Then make any interface libraries that you need (note - these will
probably require specific camera/mirror hardware libraries - you will
know what you need...)
e.g.
(cd src && make libsl240Int32cam.so)

Then do:
make install.

Then copy your interface libraries to lib e.g.:
cp src/libsl240Int32cam.so /rtc/lib


Source etc/rtc.bashrc after editing it for your requirements:

Make sure PYTHONPATH includes lib/python
Make sure your ORBInitRef environment variable points to your name
server.
Make sure lib is on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH



To run, you can then do (after running the omniORB nameserver,
omniNames, in the location pointed to by your ORBInitRef variable)):
control.py /PATH/TO/YOURCONFIGFILE -o
Then wait for a bit while it initialises and try:
darcmagic status

It is says "paused" then there is a configuration error (illegal
parameters), so you should investigate.  If it says "running" then
darc is running successfully.

A simple darctalk command line tool can also be installed without
needing the whole RTC - typically a user would have this on their
laptop.

To install this, untar the darctalk-latestversion.tgz and follow
instructions.

To make this package, make darctalk.tgz should suffice.



WINDOWS installation of the GUI:
Note, this isn't tested frequently, so may not work out of the box.
Install the following:
gtk  - check that you can import gtk in python.
numpy
matplotlib
omniORB
omniORBpy
glade
You then need to do:
omniidl -bpython control.idl
or if you can't get this to work, copy control_idl.py from a working installation.
Make directory c:/RTC/shm/
Get the darc code.
The GUI should then run... (rtcgui.py)
